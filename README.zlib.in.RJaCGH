All files in the src directory, except nnhl.c, are from zlib v. 1.2.3. We
have copied all the *.c and *.h and have removed, from the original
distribution: example.c minigzip.c. No other changes have been made to any
of the files.

We have kept the original README from zlib (in the root directory of
RJaCGH). Please read it for details.
