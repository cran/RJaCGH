1.5.6	2008-10-10    Now relabel.core sets the attributes correctly
1.5.5	2008-08-21    Fixed bug in relabelStates.RJaCGH and collapse.chain:
		      window attribute was not retained. Also, set window
		      default to 1 (not NULL).

		      DESCRIPTION.

1.5.3	2008-05-22    Changes in both pREC algorithms.
		      gelman.brooks.plot is now gelman.rubin.plot

1.5.2	2008-05-22    Additions to make sure sequence file names are
		      unique.
		      Examples for pREC_A and pREC_S now are run.
		      Beware: a bug in pREC_S so that sometimes last
		      region not found.

1.5.1	2008-05-21    Included zlib sources so that it builds in Windows.
		      Associated changes in build files, etc.

1.5.0	2008-05-13    Many major changes:
			- Parallel chains and birth/death with delayed rejection
			- Initial values for the chain
			- pREC_A and pREC_S now entirely in C. 
			- Checks in C code that return values are finite.
			- Many minor bug fixes, code clean ups, etc.

1.2.4 		      Fixed bug in MetropolisUpdate and changed move for 
		      	    sigma.2

1.2.3 		      Fixed bug in Birth move (now the prior of sigma2

1.2.2 		      Added vignette in /inst/doc/
		      Bug in print.summary.RJaCGH.Chrom
		      Typo in chainsSelect.Rd
       		      Added method for RJaCGH.Chrom in chainsSelect() and
			   bug fixing.

			   and parameters of the transition funcionts in 
			   RJaCGH.Rd
	              Removed restriction for max.dist to be higher than
			   all probe  distances.

1.2.1 	              Bug in plot.pREC_S (reordering of the array names)
		      Now one can choose the method of clustering in 
		      	  plot.pREC_S (default ward method)
		      Bug in pREC_S (nor deleting tmp files)
1.2.0 		      Homocedastic model in RJaCGH
       		      Change in priors: uniform priors for sigma     
       		      pREC_A and pREC_S
       		      Arbitrary names and number of Chromosomes
       		      Probe names
       		      Start/End positions
       		      New get.jump()
       		      New summary
       		      Bug in labellling of states
       		      New vignette
1.1.1 		      Bug in get jump.
1.1.0 		      New args to RJaCGH added: max.distance,
			   normal.reference and normal.ref.percentile
1.0.2 		      Bug Fixing:
       		      when model=genome there had to be 23 chromosomes
       		      strange bug with auto.label
       		      (Thanks to Al Ivens)
1.0.1 		      Bug fixing: 
       		      labels in legend of genome.plot
       		      plot.RJaCGH.array with an even number of chromosomes
       		      positions must be integers (bases, not Kb).
       		      (Thanks to Joao Fadista).
1.0.0 		      Probabilistic minimal commmon regions.
      		      Plot for the genome (genome.plot).
0.5 		      Bug fix in summary.RJaCGH (thanks to Douglas Grove).
0.5  		      Automatic labelling of states
0.4-3		      Functions can take distance, not just position
       		      Added preprint to inst/doc
0.4-2 		      Now collapseChain recovers loglik and probs within
			   model. 
		      Changed slightly prior for mu.
0.4-1 		      Fixed bug in plots that smooth arbitrarily too much
			   in density plots
0.4   		      Fixed Windows crash (order of evaluation issue in 
		      Combine and Split).
0.3-1 		      Use Calloc instead of R_alloc to try drive down
			   memory usage.
       		      Played with interrupts.
0.3   		      nnhl.cpp re-written as C (instead of C++) to try
			   prevent crash under Windows.
0.2   		      Real Posterior probabilities of the sequence of
			   hidden states via viterbi
