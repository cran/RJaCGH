1.1.1: Bug in get jump.
1.1.0: New args to RJaCGH added: max.distance, normal.reference and 
       normal.ref.percentile
1.0.2: Bug Fixing:
       when model=genome there had to be 23 chromosomes
       strange bug with auto.label
       (Thanks to Al Ivens)
1.0,1: Bug fixing: 
       labels in legend of genome.plot
       plot.RJaCGH.array with an even number of chromosomes
       positions must be integers (bases, not Kb).
       (Thanks to Joao Fadista).
1.0.0: Probabilistic minimal commmon regions.
      Plot for the genome (genome.plot).
0.5.: Bug fix in summary.RJaCGH (thanks to Douglas Grove).
0.5:  Automatic labelling of states
0.4-3: Functions can take distance, not just position
       Added preprint to inst/doc
0.4-2: Now collapseChain recovers loglik and probs within model. Changed
       slightly prior for mu.
0.4-1: Fixed bug in plots that smooth arbitrarily too much in density plots
0.4:   Fixed Windows crash (order of evaluation issue in Combine and Split).
0.3-1: Use Calloc instead of R_alloc to try drive down memory usage.
       Played with interrupts.
0.3:   nnhl.cpp re-written as C (instead of C++) to try prevent crash under 
       Windows.
0.2:   Real Posterior probabilities of the sequence of hidden states via viterbi
