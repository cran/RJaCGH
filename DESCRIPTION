Description: Bayesian analysis of CGH microarrays fitting Hidden Markov
        Chain models. The selection of the number of states is made via
        their posterior probability computed by Reversible Jump Markov
        Chain Monte Carlo Methods. Also returns probabilistic common
        regions for gains/losses.
